This egg is a port of the QobiScheme UI to Chicken. Currently
undocumented but ''examples/define-application-example.scm'' provides
a good introduction. One minor incompatibility with QobiScheme is that
''abort'' is renamed to ''abort-gui'' to avoid a name clash with
Chicken.

define-command is slightly incompatible with QobiScheme's
implementation. It expects arguments to be passed to it directly
rather than through a list and it does not require the program name.
